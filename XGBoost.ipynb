Here you will use the early_stopping_rounds parameter in xgb.cv() with a large possible number of boosting rounds (50). Bear in mind that if the holdout metric continuously improves up through when num_boost_rounds is reached, then early stopping does not occur.\n",

You've already seen this if you've ever worked with scikit-learn's RandomForestClassifier or RandomForestRegressor, where it just was called max_features. In both xgboost and sklearn, this parameter (although named differently) simply specifies the fraction of features to choose from at every split in a given tree. In xgboost, colsample_bytree must be specified as a float between 0 and 1."

You can refer to how the numeric imputation mapper was created as a template. Notice the keyword arguments input_df=True and df_out=True? This is so that you can work with DataFrames instead of arrays. By default, the transformers are passed a numpy array of the selected columns as input, and as a result, the output of the DataFrame mapper is also an array. Scikit-learn transformers have historically been designed to work with numpy arrays, not pandas DataFrames, even though their basic indexing interfaces are similar."
